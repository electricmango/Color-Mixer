###Read Me.
Thanks for reading the readme.

I have no plans to add main updates to Color Mixer because Color Mixer will be implemented to [Color Utility](http://github.com/leocarbon/cu). If you're interested in Color Mixer, you should definitely [check it out](http://github.com/leocarbon/cu).

Further, if you have some suggestions and want to add some features of yourself, add some code and do a pull request. I'll review and add those changes.
